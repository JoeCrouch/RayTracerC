# RayTracerC

A Raytracer which can produce multiple planes and spheres with shadows and multiple light sources. ATM the positions of objects in the scene, lights, and center are hardcoded in the main.cpp file. When run the program will produce a bitmap image of the scene in the location of the executable. See: RayTraceExample.bmp for a simple scene with one sphere and one plane.

TODOS(Not Prioritised):
* Clean Up - Higher level of encapsulation
* Add Tests
* Have user input locations of objects, lights etc rather than hard coding
* Consider creating basic UI for above TODO
